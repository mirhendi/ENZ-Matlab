# Fitenz (Matlab)

This software is developed to determine the fittest enzymes in Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The input data is a FASTA file from homogeneous organisms DNA sequences. The algorithm is able to rank enzymes that can distinguish RFLP patterns of the input sequences.

# To use the program
Place all the input sequences with FASTA format in a text file and name it as input_sequences.txt. Run the fitenz.m file in Matlab.
